 
FPGA VIRTUALIZATION USING THE MXP OVERLAY ARCHITECTURE :

MXP LINUX SET UP:
Mxp Linux set up file mxplinuxsetup.doc tells about configuring the MXP overlay with the Xilinx Zynq. 
 

PERFORMANCE MEASURES:

FILTERGRAPHS consist of the performance graphs for the filters CHEBYSHEV, MIBENCH and QSPLINE.
KERNELGRAPHS consist of the FFT, KMEANS, MM, SPMV, STENCIL and MRI. 
POLYTESTGRAPHS consist of the polynomial performance results.
Number of Samples vs time taken plots for the polynomial (quadratic and cubic samples) in different platforms present in  polynomial_graphs_of_samplesvstimetaken(msec). 

SOURCE CODE:
source folder consist of the mxp code for the various benchmarks
